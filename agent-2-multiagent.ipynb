    "## Employee Onboarding: From Tangled Yarn to Clear Roadmap with LangGraph!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Old Way:\n",
    "Onboarding is often manual, slow, and confusing – like a tangled ball of yarn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our New Way:\n",
    "We use a smart system powered by LangGraph to make it smooth and automated – like a clear roadmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demo Flow: Alex's Onboarding Journey\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Demo Start: Offer Accepted!**\n",
    "    *   Alex accepts her job offer! This kicks off the automated process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Step 1: Start Alex's Journey**\n",
    "    *   The system gets Alex's basic info.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Step 2: Decide the Path (Decision Point!)**\n",
    "    *   The system quickly checks if Alex's role needs a background check.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Step 3: (If Needed) Background Check**\n",
    "    *   If **YES**, the system starts the background check.\n",
    "    *   If **NO**, it skips this and moves on.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Step 4: (If Needed) Check Result (Potential Failure End)**\n",
    "    *   If a background check was done, the system sees if it passed.\n",
    "    *   If it **FAILED**, the process stops here.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Step 5: Do Two Things at Once! (Parallel Action!)**\n",
    "    *   If the background check passed (or wasn't needed), the system now does two important things *at the same time*:\n",
    "        *   Tell HR to start the paperwork.\n",
    "        *   Tell IT to start setting up Alex's computer access.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Step 6: Bring It Together & Finalize (Parallel Join & Final Action)**\n",
    "    *   The system waits until *both* HR and IT confirm they've started their tasks.\n",
    "    *   Once confirmed, it does the final steps, like scheduling Alex's first-day welcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Step 7: Onboarding Complete! (Success End)**\n",
    "    *   Alex is ready for her first day! The process finishes successfully.\n",
